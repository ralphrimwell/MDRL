# MDRL
A minimal HTTP Discord API wrapper intended for self-botting

    This is a work in progress, and will likely introduce breaking changes.
    
#How to install
    pip install git+https://github.com/ralphrimwell/MDRL.git

## Todo

  

    - Ratelimit handler, possibly seperate from the client to account for ip instead of user
    
    - Headers generator, to allow for more random data
    
    - Guild permissions calculator
